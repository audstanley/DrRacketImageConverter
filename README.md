# Dr Racket Image Converter

This is, by far, the worst way to make an image in Dr. Racket, but it's also a lot of fun.
Drop a .png or .jpg in to the images folder. run the app.js by navigating to the project folder, and running

You will first need to install NodeJs [version 6 or 7](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```sh
npm install;
node app.js;
```

You will be prompted to input the name of the image that you want to convert to dr. racket (the image must be in the image folder).
Then you will be prompted to give a multiplier in order to blow up the image.  If you want to keep the pixel size the same as the orginal image
then your multiplier would be: 1. Finally, indicate whether you want the pixels to be a circle or square.

#### Options:

 1. Open Dr. Racket, select Language => Add Teachpack => Advanced Student => draw.rkt
then paste your code from the dr_racket_code.txt into the Dr. Racket Application.
 2. or, you can open the draw.rkt file, and paste the same code and run it.
 
**Then run it.**
