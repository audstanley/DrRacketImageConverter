# Dr Racket Image Converter

This is, by far, the worst way to make an image in Dr. Racket, but it's also a lot of fun.
Drop a .png or .jpg in to the images folder. run the app.js by navigating to the project folder, and running

sh
```
npm install;
node app.js;
```

You will be prompted to input the name of the image that you want to convert to dr. racket (the image must be in the image folder).
Then you will be prompted to give a multiplier in order to blow up the image.  If you want to keep the pixel size the same as the orginal image
then your multiplier would be: 1.
